# Day-Planner

The first thing I did was browse through bootstrap and find and template that fit the outline.
I attached the bootstrap link beneath the Meta Tags to allow for functionalability.
Used Font awesome to add little footballs as icons for the save buttons. 
Now I have a very basic template with a header, columns for time, textareas, and save buttons.
Going to start adding some color.
Added links to jquery and moment.js for later functions on the script page.

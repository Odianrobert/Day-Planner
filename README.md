# Day-Planner

The first thing I did was browse through bootstrap and find and template that fit the outline.
I attached the bootstrap link beneath the Meta Tags to allow for functionalability.
Used Font awesome to add little footballs as icons for the save buttons. 
Now I have a very basic template with a header, columns for time, textareas, and save buttons.
Going to start adding some color.
Added links to jquery and moment.js for later functions on the script page.
Need to make the text that the user types into the textarea will stay upon page refresh.  Will use localstorage.
Need to make a fucntion that color codes the hours based on real time using moment.js.
